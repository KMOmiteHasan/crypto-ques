                <h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a
                    peer-to-peer system
                    that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money
                    carried around and
                    exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online
                    database describing
                    specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a
                    public ledger.
                    Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets. <br><br>

                    Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means
                    advanced coding is
                    involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The
                    aim of encryption is
                    to provide security and safety. <br><br>

                    The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today.
                    Much of the interest
                    in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.
                </p>

                <h2>How does cryptocurrency work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions
                    updated and held by
                    currency holders.<br><br>

                    Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer
                    power to solve
                    complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from
                    brokers, then store and
                    spend them using cryptographic wallets.<br><br>

                    If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to
                    move a record or a
                    unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.<br><br>

                    Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain
                    technology are still
                    emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds,
                    stocks, and other
                    financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.
                </p>

                <h2>Cryptocurrency examples</h2>
                <p>
                    There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Some of the best known include:
                </p>

                <h3>Bitcoin:</h3>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most commonly traded. The
                    currency was developed
                    by Satoshi Nakamoto – widely believed to be a pseudonym for an individual or group of people whose
                    precise identity
                    remains unknown.
                </p>

                <h3>Ethereum:</h3>
                <p>
                    Developed in 2015, Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH)
                    or
                    Ethereum. It is
                    the most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.
                </p>

                <h3>Litecoin:</h3>
                <p>
                    This currency is most similar to bitcoin but has moved more quickly to develop new innovations,
                    including faster
                    payments and processes to allow more transactions.
                </p>

                <h3>Ripple:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ripple is a distributed ledger system that was founded in 2012. Ripple can be used to track
                    different
                    kinds of
                    transactions, not just cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with various banks and
                    financial
                    institutions.

                    <strong>Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are collectively known as “altcoins” to distinguish them from
                        the original.</strong>
